-> example flask app lesson overview  
   -> this lesson introduces the architecture and features of an example flask app, **microblog**, which serves as the foundation for the course project, **ragtime**  

-> introduction  
   -> in this course, you will build a music-sharing social network, **ragtime**, designed as a social platform for connecting users through music  
   -> ragtime is based on an open-source flask application called **microblog**, which showcases flask's simplicity and versatility  
   -> this lesson provides an overview of the key features and structure of **microblog**, giving you a preview of the development journey ahead  

-> features of microblog  
   microblog demonstrates how flask and its extensions can be leveraged to create a fully functional, modern web application. its features include  

   -> **storing users and content in a database**  
      -> data is stored persistently using a relational database like sqlite or postgresql  
      -> example: user accounts, posts, and relationships (e.g., followers) are maintained in the database  

      -> example code: setting up a database model for users and posts  
         ```python  
         from flask import Flask  
         from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy  

         app = Flask(__name__)  
         app.config["SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"] = "sqlite:///microblog.db"  
         db = SQLAlchemy(app)  

         class User(db.Model):  
             id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)  
             username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)  
             posts = db.relationship("Post", backref="author", lazy=True)  

         class Post(db.Model):  
             id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)  
             content = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=False)  
             user_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey("user.id"), nullable=False)  

         if __name__ == "__main__":  
             db.create_all()  
         ```  

   -> **attractive styling of web pages**  
      -> html, css, and javascript work seamlessly with flask's template engine, jinja2, to create responsive designs  

      -> example code: using a bootstrap template for styling  
         ```html  
         <!doctype html>  
         <html lang="en">  
         <head>  
             <link href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">  
         </head>  
         <body>  
             <div class="container">  
                 <h1>Welcome to Microblog!</h1>  
             </div>  
         </body>  
         </html>  
         ```  

   -> **email delivery and verification**  
      -> flask supports sending and receiving emails, including user registration confirmation emails and password resets  

      -> example code: sending a registration confirmation email  
         ```python  
         from flask_mail import Mail, Message  

         app.config['MAIL_SERVER'] = 'smtp.example.com'  
         app.config['MAIL_PORT'] = 587  
         app.config['MAIL_USE_TLS'] = True  
         app.config['MAIL_USERNAME'] = 'you@example.com'  
         app.config['MAIL_PASSWORD'] = 'password'  
         mail = Mail(app)  

         @app.route("/send_email")  
         def send_email():  
             msg = Message("Hello", recipients=["user@example.com"])  
             msg.body = "Thanks for registering!"  
             mail.send(msg)  
             return "Email sent!"  
         ```  

   -> **user authentication and registration**  
      -> user login and registration systems are built-in, and flask extensions such as flask-login and flask-wtf simplify the process  

      -> example code: setting up user login functionality with flask-login  
         ```python  
         from flask_login import LoginManager, UserMixin, login_user  

         login_manager = LoginManager()  
         login_manager.init_app(app)  

         class User(UserMixin):  
             def __init__(self, id):  
                 self.id = id  

         @login_manager.user_loader  
         def load_user(user_id):  
             return User(user_id)  

         @app.route("/login")  
         def login():  
             user = User(1)  
             login_user(user)  
             return "Logged in!"  
         ```  

   -> **user permissions and roles**  
      -> flask-principal or custom logic can be used to manage user roles (admin, regular user) and permissions  

      -> example code: setting up role-based access control with flask-principal  
         ```python  
         from flask_principal import Permission, RoleNeed  

         admin_role = RoleNeed("admin")  
         admin_permission = Permission(admin_role)  

         @app.route("/admin")  
         @admin_permission.require(http_exception=403)  
         def admin_panel():  
             return "Welcome to the admin panel"  
         ```  

   -> **creating and editing blog posts and profiles**  
      -> users can interact with the platform by creating blog posts, updating profiles, and interacting with others  

      -> example code: allowing users to create blog posts  
         ```python  
         @app.route("/create_post", methods=["POST"])  
         def create_post():  
             content = request.form["content"]  
             post = Post(content=content, author=current_user)  
             db.session.add(post)  
             db.session.commit()  
             return redirect(url_for("index"))  
         ```  

   -> **users can follow other users**  
      -> microblog includes a social element, where users can follow and unfollow other users  

   -> **provides an api**  
      -> microblog exposes an api for external applications to interact with  

-> microblog source code  
   -> now, let's dive into the source code of **microblog**. while it's not necessary to understand everything at this point, reviewing the structure can help you grasp the overall organisation of a flask app  

   -> **github repository structure**  
      - you can explore the files and folders on github. below is an outline of the folder structure for microblog  

      -> **app**  
         - contains the core of the web application, including models and routes  

      -> **api**  
         - contains the api functionality for interacting with the application programmatically  

      -> **auth**  
         - handles user authentication and registration  

      -> **errors**  
         - custom error handling for common issues like 404 or 500 errors  

      -> **main**  
         - contains core functionality like displaying posts, user profiles, and feed  

      -> **static**  
         - where static files (css, javascript, images) are stored  

      -> **templates**  
         - the html files that define the structure of the website  

      -> **deployment**  
         - configuration and settings for deploying the app to a production environment  

      -> **migrations**  
         - scripts for managing database migrations  

      -> **config.py**  
         - contains configuration settings for the app, including database and email settings  

      -> **microblog.py**  
         - main entry point where the flask app is instantiated  

   -> after exploring the repository, remember, all these topics will be covered in more detail throughout the course  

-> summary: microblog / ragtime example project architecture  
   -> microblog is an open-source application that serves as the foundation for the **ragtime** project  
   -> by exploring microblog, you'll get a feel for how flask applications are structured and how the different components interact  
   -> the app uses a variety of flask extensions to handle tasks such as user authentication, email verification, and api creation  
   -> the goal is to clone the microblog source code, explore it, and get comfortable with its structure before diving deeper into building your own app
